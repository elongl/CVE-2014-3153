> The futex_requeue function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not ensure that calls have two different futex addresses, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted FUTEX_REQUEUE command that facilitates unsafe waiter modification.

## Kernel Crash
- [Parent] Locking the PI-aware futex. In userspace, atomically overwrite futex with the ownerâ€™s TID.
- [Child] Wait on a non-PI futex, and later requeue to a PI-aware futex.  
    - Create a futex queue entry and set its members to point to the stack variables.
    ```c
    q.bitset = bitset;
    q.rt_waiter = &rt_waiter;
    q.requeue_pi_key = &key2;
    ```
    - Enqueue the futex queue entry (`futex_q`) onto the `futex_hash_bucket`.
    - Call `schedule()` and wait for the task to be flagged for rescheduling (sleep meanwhile).
- [Parent] Requeue the non-PI futex to the PI-aware futex.
